# UdaciFitness
This Repository includes the code for a mobile triathlon app written in React Native.

The initial version was using the "class" approach and other technologies that are now obsolete.
In 2022, I reviewed the app to upgrade it by adopting React latest best practices such as Hooks. Hooks are now used to manage component states and also to connect to the Redux store.

This project includes concepts such as:

* React Native
* Redux
* Expo
* Hooks
* Calendar
* Animations
* Geo Location
* Notification
